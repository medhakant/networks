There are 3 files. 'requirements.sh','script.py' and 'dump'.

'requirements.sh' contains all the packages to install.
run it with "chmod +x requirements.sh && ./requirements.sh"

'script.py' captures all the data and appends it to file dump which 
should be placed in the same folder. Run 'script.py' with root 
privelges as "python script.py" and the script takes a really
long time to execure ~30minutes, so be patient.

Also clear the dump file before recording your data.
